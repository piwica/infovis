    Osvaldo is a longlife friend of Bodrogi. 
    He proposed to the activists to form a social movement organization with an identity brand and a specific agenda as a mechanism for interfacing with the government of Kronos.  
    The group chose the name “Protectors of Kronos” and developed a logo consisting of an open right hand rising from the land on a black background.  
    Additionally, Osvaldo contacted Wellness for All (WFA), an international agency that specialized in providing clean water for rural communities.
